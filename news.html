                This year has already been a damaging one for wildfires in Greece with the most recent example being the large blaze on Mount Penteli in Athens northern suburbs that ignited on July 19th.
            </p>
                
              <p>  In the first few months of 2022, thirty forest fires were recorded in the country, a massive increase from the usual four. Those fires burned over 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) of land compared to the average 37.5 (around 92 acres).
                
                Since June, the wildfires in Greece have brought more devastation with strong winds and dry weather fanning the flames.

                Small fires continued to burn in the areas of Dioni, Dasamari, Anthousa, Panorama Pallini, and Drafi, but they were being contained, officials said. Dozens of houses were either entirely burned or damaged by the fire. Thirty-four people were hospitalized while nine settlements were evacuated.

                The wildfire in the area of Rethymno, rekindled from strong winds a day after it had been doused. That area in the Cretan municipality of Agios Georgios includes luxury rental homes for tourists, some of which were evacuated. The mayor said he believed the fire was a result of arson.

                The morning wildfire in Feriza prompted calls for nearby residents to evacuate amid strong winds, as a hundred firefighters, volunteers, and municipal workers responded to the blaze that broke out in a vegetated area of Feriza. July 15th was a particularly devastating one. A total of 51 wildfires were recorded throughout Greece in a 24-hour period.

                The wildfire had deadly consequences when a helicopter that had been battling the blaze crashed into the sea, killing two of the four people aboard. Authorities said 27 firefighters, four water-dropping aircraft, and three helicopters had been dispatched to the blaze.

                A large wildfire broke out at Porto Germeno, a seaside resort west of Athens, forcing authorities to evacuate a nearby village. Strong north-westerly winds in the area of the Gulf of Corinth pushed that blaze toward the town of Psatha.

                July 4th , Schimatari, North of Athens
                A wildfire that broke at Schimatari north of Athens was eventually brought under control. At one point, municipal authorities called for the precautionary evacuation of Dilesi, a seaside resort town in the region of Viotia.

                June 24 , Mount Athos
                A fire that broke out on the holy site of Mt Athos did not damage the monasteries the region is famous for. The fire started at night in a forested area of Mt Athos, referred to in Greek as the “Holy Mountain.”

                </p>
                Strong winds have fueled the recent fires, and an afternoon blaze at the foothills of Mount Hymettus was no different. In that fire in the southern suburb of Ano Glyfada, officials evacuated residents of several areas in the neighboring Ano Voula and Vari. Wind gusts that reached 8 Beaufort propelled the fire, Yiannis Artopoios, a fire department spokesperson said.

            <h2>Greece Battles Fierce Wildfires Amid Europe Heatwaves</h2>

            <p> ATHENS — 
                Greece on Sunday battled four major wildfires that have forced hundreds to evacuate, as soaring temperatures there and in Spain raised fears of more blazes.
                
                Scientists say human-induced climate change is amplifying extreme weather, including the heatwaves, droughts and floods seen in several parts of the planet in recent weeks, and say these events will become more frequent and more intense.</p>
                
                <p>Greece is in the grip of a heatwave that began on Saturday and is expected to last 10 days. Temperatures were set to rise to 42 degrees Celsius in some regions.
                
                Fire brigade spokesperson Yiannis Artopoios told a briefing on Sunday evening that Greece was facing "an explosive cocktail of drought, high temperatures and strong winds."
                
                Fires raged in the north, east and south of the country, including on the tourist island of Lesbos, where about 200 people were ordered to leave the village of Vryssa on Sunday to escape the flames.
                
                Elderly women left the village carrying a few possessions in plastic bags, as thick smoke engulfed the first houses.
                
                On Saturday residents and tourists were told to leave the island's beach village of Vatera.
                </p>
                <p>In the northeastern region of Evros, hundreds of firefighters battled a wildfire for a fourth day in Dadia National Park, known for its black vulture colony.
                
                Evros governor Dimitris Petrovits told Athens News Agency the authorities were doing all they could to protect locals and treat injured wildlife.
                
                In the south, a fire in the Peloponnese caused the evacuation of three villages and a children's summer camp, while on the island of Crete a fire was raging inside a ravine.
                </p>
                <p>
                     This part of Andalusia registered Spain's highest-ever temperature, 47.7C, last year.
                 
                </p>
                <p>The national weather office said the relentless heatwave since July 9 and the lack of rain since the start of the year across the Iberian Peninsula meant there was an extreme risk of fires.</p>
                <p>In all, fires in France, Spain and Portugal have burned more land so far this year than was destroyed by flames in all of 2021. The area, 517,881 hectares, is equivalent to the size of Trinidad and Tobago.
                
                The World Health Organization said Friday that Europe's heatwaves had led to "more than 1,700 needless deaths … in Spain and Portugal alone."
               </p>
               <p>Firefighters in Britain were battling blazes in London on Sunday, days after the mercury climbed to 40.3C and smashed the country's temperature record.
                
                The London Fire Brigade said it was dealing with more incidents than usual, with 205 personnel and 28 fire engines deployed to tackle fires at three sites across the capital.
                
                It urged the public to cancel barbecues and remove rubbish from grassland.
               </p>
               <p>In France, the government announced on Sunday it was bringing in rules to curb energy waste, which adds needlessly to the greenhouse gas emissions that fuel climate change.
                
                Shops will be ordered to keep their doors closed when their air-conditioning or heating is on or risk a fine, energy transition minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told RMC radio.
                
                Leaving the doors open when the air conditioning is on leads to "20 percent more consumption and … it's absurd," she said.</p>
